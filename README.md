# FaunaDB Mastery with Next.js, TypeScript, and GraphQL

Welcome to the **FaunaDB Mastery with Next.js, TypeScript, and GraphQL** course! This course is designed to take you from a complete beginner to a proficient developer in building and managing applications using FaunaDB in conjunction with Next.js, TypeScript, and GraphQL. Throughout this course, you will learn foundational concepts, advanced features, and best practices for integrating FaunaDB into modern web applications.

## Course Overview

This course provides a comprehensive guide to mastering FaunaDB, focusing on how to build scalable, efficient, and secure applications using the following technologies:

- **FaunaDB**: A serverless database that provides a flexible data model and real-time capabilities.
- **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need.
