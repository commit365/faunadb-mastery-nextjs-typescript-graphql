# Lesson 12: Capstone Project

## Overview

In this final lesson, we will guide you through the process of planning, designing, and implementing a full-stack application using FaunaDB, Next.js, and GraphQL. This capstone project will consolidate your learning throughout the course and provide you with practical experience in building a complete application. We will cover the steps involved in implementing core features, integrating advanced GraphQL concepts and external services, deploying the application, and preparing it for production. Finally, we will discuss the challenges faced during the project and how to present your work effectively.

## 1. Planning and Designing a Full-stack Application

### a. Defining the Project Scope

Before diving into development, it’s essential to define the scope of your project. Consider the following aspects:

- **Target Audience**: Who will use your application? What problems does it solve for them?
- **Core Features**: Identify the key features that your application will offer. For example, if you're building a task management app, core features might include user authentication, task creation, task assignment, and real-time updates.
- **User Stories**: Write user stories to capture the functionality from the user's perspective. For example:
  - As a user, I want to create a new task so that I can track my work.
  - As a user, I want to receive notifications when a task is updated.

### b. Designing the Application Architecture

1. **Frontend**: Use Next.js for the frontend, leveraging its server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities.
2. **Backend**: Use FaunaDB as your database, utilizing GraphQL for data queries and mutations.
3. **Authentication**: Implement user authentication using Auth0 or a similar service to manage user sessions and security.

### c. Creating Wireframes

Create wireframes or mockups for your application’s user interface. Tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD can be used to design the layout and flow of your application. Focus on usability and ensure that the interface aligns with user stories.

## 2. Implementing Core Features with Best Practices

### a. Setting Up the Project Structure

1. **Initialize Your Next.js Application**:

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app my-capstone-project
   cd my-capstone-project
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install apollo-client graphql @apollo/client @auth0/nextjs-auth0 faunadb
   ```

3. **Set Up FaunaDB**: Create a new database in FaunaDB and set up collections needed for your application (e.g., `users`, `tasks`).

### b. Implementing Authentication

Follow the steps outlined in Lesson 6 to set up user authentication using Auth0. Ensure that users can sign up, log in, and log out.

### c. Building GraphQL API

1. **Define the GraphQL Schema**: Create a schema that includes types for tasks and queries for fetching and mutating tasks.

   ```graphql
   type Task {
     id: ID!
     title: String!
     completed: Boolean!
     userId: ID!
   }

   type Query {
     getTasks: [Task!]!
   }

   type Mutation {
     createTask(title: String!, userId: ID!): Task!
     updateTask(id: ID!, completed: Boolean!): Task!
     deleteTask(id: ID!): ID!
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Resolvers**: Write resolvers for the queries and mutations defined in your schema, ensuring they interact with FaunaDB to perform the necessary operations.

### d. Frontend Implementation

1. **Create Pages and Components**: Build pages for your application, such as a dashboard for displaying tasks and forms for creating and updating tasks.
2. **Use Apollo Client**: Set up Apollo Client to interact with your GraphQL API and manage state in your application.

   ```javascript
   import { ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/client';
   import client from '../lib/apolloClient';

   function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
     return (
       <ApolloProvider client={client}>
         <Component {...pageProps} />
       </ApolloProvider>
     );
   }

   export default MyApp;
   ```

3. **Handle User Interactions**: Implement functionality for users to create, update, and delete tasks, ensuring that the UI updates in real-time using GraphQL subscriptions if applicable.

## 3. Integrating Advanced GraphQL Concepts and External Services

### a. Using Subscriptions for Real-time Updates

Implement GraphQL subscriptions to allow users to receive real-time updates when tasks are created, updated, or deleted. This enhances user experience by providing immediate feedback.

### b. Integrating External Services

Consider integrating external services that can enhance your application. For example:

- **Email Notifications**: Use a service like SendGrid to send email notifications when tasks are assigned or due.
- **Analytics**: Integrate Google Analytics or a similar service to track user interactions and gather insights.

## 4. Deploying the Application and Preparing for Production

### a. Deploying to Vercel

1. **Create a Vercel Account**: Sign up for a free account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
2. **Import Your Project**: Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel and import your project.
3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Set up environment variables in Vercel for your FaunaDB secret and Auth0 credentials.
4. **Deploy**: Click the "Deploy" button to launch your application.

### b. Preparing for Production

1. **Optimize Performance**: Ensure that your application is optimized for performance, including code splitting, image optimization, and caching strategies.
2. **Security Audits**: Conduct security audits to ensure that your application is secure against common vulnerabilities.

## 5. Presenting the Project and Discussing Challenges Faced

### a. Preparing Your Presentation

1. **Project Overview**: Prepare a brief overview of your project, including its purpose, target audience, and core features.
2. **Demonstration**: Create a live demonstration of your application, showcasing its functionality and user interface.
3. **Challenges and Solutions**: Discuss any challenges you faced during development and how you overcame them. This could include technical hurdles, design decisions, or integration issues.

### b. Gathering Feedback

After your presentation, gather feedback from peers or mentors. Use this feedback to make improvements and refine your application further.
