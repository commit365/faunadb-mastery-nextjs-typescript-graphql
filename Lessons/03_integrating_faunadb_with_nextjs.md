# Lesson 3: Integrating FaunaDB with Next.js

## Overview

In this lesson, we will explore how to integrate FaunaDB with a Next.js application. This integration allows you to leverage the capabilities of FaunaDB, such as its flexible data model and powerful querying capabilities, within your web applications. We will cover the installation of necessary packages, creating a FaunaDB client, connecting to FaunaDB from API routes, and best practices for managing database connections. By the end of this lesson, you will be equipped to build applications that effectively utilize FaunaDB as their backend database.

## 1. Installing Necessary Packages

To begin, you need to set up a new Next.js application and install the required packages for integrating FaunaDB.

### Creating a New Next.js Application

If you haven't already created a Next.js application, you can do so using the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app nextjs-faunadb
```

Change into the newly created directory:

```bash
cd nextjs-faunadb
```

### Installing FaunaDB Client

Next, install the FaunaDB JavaScript driver, which allows you to interact with your FaunaDB database:

```bash
npm install faunadb
```

If you plan to use GraphQL with FaunaDB, you may also want to install the `graphql-request` library:

```bash
npm install graphql-request
```

## 2. Creating a FaunaDB Client in a Next.js Application

Now that you have the necessary packages installed, you will create a FaunaDB client to interact with your database.

### Setting Up the FaunaDB Client

1. **Create a New Directory for Configuration**: Inside your project, create a new directory called `lib` to store your configuration files.

```bash
mkdir lib
```

2. **Create the FaunaDB Client File**: Inside the `lib` directory, create a file called `faunaClient.js` (or `faunaClient.ts` if using TypeScript) and add the following code:

```javascript
// lib/faunaClient.js
import faunadb from 'faunadb';

const client = new faunadb.Client({
  secret: process.env.FAUNADB_SECRET, // Your FaunaDB secret key
  domain: 'db.fauna.com', // FaunaDB domain
  scheme: 'https', // Use HTTPS
});

export default client;
```

### Environment Variables

To securely store your FaunaDB secret key, create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add your FaunaDB secret key:

```plaintext
FAUNADB_SECRET=your_faunadb_secret_key_here
```

Make sure to replace `your_faunadb_secret_key_here` with the actual secret key you obtained from the FaunaDB dashboard.

## 3. Connecting to FaunaDB from API Routes

Next.js provides a convenient way to create API routes that can interact with your database. We will create an API route to handle requests to FaunaDB.

### Creating an API Route

1. **Create a New API Route**: Inside the `pages/api` directory, create a file called `users.js` (or `users.ts` for TypeScript).

2. **Add the Following Code**:

```javascript
// pages/api/users.js
import client from '../../lib/faunaClient';
import { query as q } from 'faunadb';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === 'GET') {
    try {
      const users = await client.query(
        q.Paginate(q.Documents(q.Collection('users')))
      );
      res.status(200).json(users.data);
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch users' });
    }
  } else if (req.method === 'POST') {
    const { name, email } = req.body;
    try {
      const user = await client.query(
        q.Create(q.Collection('users'), { data: { name, email } })
      );
      res.status(201).json(user);
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to create user' });
    }
  } else {
    res.setHeader('Allow', ['GET', 'POST']);
    res.status(405).end(`Method ${req.method} Not Allowed`);
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **GET Request**: When a GET request is made to the `/api/users` endpoint, it queries the `users` collection in FaunaDB and returns the list of users.
- **POST Request**: When a POST request is made to the same endpoint, it creates a new user in the `users` collection using the data provided in the request body.
- **Error Handling**: The API route includes basic error handling to return appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.

## 4. Best Practices for Managing Database Connections

When working with FaunaDB in a Next.js application, it's essential to follow best practices for managing database connections to ensure optimal performance and security.

### Best Practices

1. **Use Environment Variables**: Always store sensitive information such as your FaunaDB secret key in environment variables to avoid exposing them in your codebase.

2. **Create a Singleton Client**: To prevent creating multiple instances of the FaunaDB client, export a single instance from your client configuration file. This approach reduces overhead and improves performance.

3. **Limit API Route Scope**: Keep your API routes focused on specific tasks (e.g., user management, product management) to maintain clean and organized code.

4. **Implement Error Handling**: Always include error handling in your API routes to manage unexpected issues gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to users.

5. **Optimize Queries**: Use FaunaDB's indexing capabilities to optimize your queries for better performance. Ensure that you create indexes for any fields you frequently query against.

6. **Monitor Performance**: Regularly monitor the performance of your queries and API routes. Use FaunaDB's built-in monitoring tools to track usage and identify any bottlenecks.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you have learned how to integrate FaunaDB with a Next.js application by installing necessary packages, creating a FaunaDB client, connecting to FaunaDB from API routes, and following best practices for managing database connections. This integration lays the foundation for building robust applications that leverage the power of FaunaDB.

### Next Steps

In the next lesson, we will explore how to build a GraphQL API with FaunaDB, allowing you to take advantage of the flexibility and efficiency of GraphQL for querying your data.
